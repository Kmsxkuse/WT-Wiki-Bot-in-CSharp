# War Thunder Wiki Bot
Crunching datamined War Thunder Weapon Files since 2016.

Exe file to run located in bin/Debug
Output files located in War-Thunder-Files/export, file extension ".wiki".
  You can open these files with any text editor.

Output files have already been made with my aces.vromf.bin but if you want to see if there is any difference in files, replace the aces.vromf.bin with the one located in your War Thunder game directory.

Test previews are located on https://wiki.warthunder.com/index.php?title=User:U16697154
